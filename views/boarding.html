        <h2>Need Boarding? We're here to help!</h2>
            
        <p>Pets-R-Us is happy to now offer boarding for your pets for up to a month at a time. Exceptions can be made on a case by case basis for over a month with more than two weeks notice. Our state of the art facility offers many luxuries to keep your pets happy and entertained. We primarily offer dog boarding but can also facilitate our feline friends, reptile friends and avian buddies as well! Our outdoor doggy water park not only provides fun in the sun but a chance to cool off and even get clean while playing. Our obstacle course sees constant play from dogs big and small. Our cat climbing wall is the only one in the Midwest and has our cat friends overjoyed with options to hide and seek. We are also highly trained in caring for pets with special needs or physical injuries. We have an on-call veterinarian who can provide emergency care and long term maintenance for any issue. Don't hesitate to contact us and let us know your special needs as we will go above and beyond to show your and your bet outstanding service! Also, don't forget to inquire about our veteran, first-responder, student and senior citizen discounts.</p>
        

        <h2>Specialty Animals</h2>

        <p>As mentioned above, we can facilitate the needs of almost any pet aside from fish or farm animals. We can handle almost all types of reptiles. We do ask that you give one weeks advanced notice for reptiles and birds since the sizing for their habitats needs to be considered.</p>

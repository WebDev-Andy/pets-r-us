        <h2>Training</h2>
            
        <p>At Pets-R-Us, we have multiple world class trainers leading our teams and your dogs in exceptional training methods. Brenda and John are our two main trainers with a combined 48 years of experience with various types of dog training. John has training military working dogs as well as many states K9 units. He has attending training workshops in many other countries over the years to gain even more worldly training techniques. Brenda comes from a family of dog trainers and grew up with her father teaching her everything he knew after he retired from his local SWAT K9 unit. She knew from a young age that she wanted to follow in his footstep but with an emphasis on more family focused dog training. She has also learned from many working farm dog and sheep dog trainers to gain even more expertise on various training methods. They both give training classes to their teams and provide hours of certification, ensuring that their teams are compliant with standards and best practices. They both recommend starting training as early as possible but understand that this is not always possible for all dog owners. The added difficulty to training older dogs can be overcome by scheduling specialty sessions with Brenda or John. Even elderly dogs can gain some improvement with the right training methods and patience. There are many different options from basic to more advanced training to include service dog training and working dog training. Please reach out to us with your needs and we'll work to meet them at our first availabilities.</p>
